# GoodFood

GoodFood is my first fullstack developed website that saves reviews of the restaurants with rating, menus, address, and additional information.
GoodFood contains two main pages, one is to show all the restaurant reviews, and the other one is to add the review of the restaurant.

For frontend, I used Vue.js and for backend, I used Spring.

Although it was a very simple website, full stack developing for the first time was fun but also hard at the same time.
I believe I learned a lot from this experience and for my future development, I know I can do much better.
